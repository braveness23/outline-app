## <a name="quick-start"> Quick Start </a>

### 1. Set up environment

Place a paper on a flat surface that has good contrast with the paper. Ensure the lighting is consistent and avoid reflections as much as possible.

<ExportedImage
  className="object-contain !relative max-h-[30vh]"
  src={paperOnTable}
  alt={"A4 Paper on a brown table"}
  priority
  fill
></ExportedImage>

### 2. Place object on top of a paper sheet

Place the object you want to measure or calibrate on top of the A4 paper. Make sure the object is centered and not touching the edges of the paper.

<ExportedImage
  className="object-contain !relative max-h-[30vh]"
  src={caliperOnPaper}
  alt={
    "Digital caliper placed on top of the A4 paper which is on a brown table"
  }
  priority
  fill
></ExportedImage>

### 3. Take picture

Take a picture of the setup, ensuring the entire paper and object are visible and centered in the frame. Use the camera's highest resolution to capture as much detail as possible.

<ExportedImage
  className="object-contain !relative max-h-[50vh]"
  src={detailsForm}
  alt={
    "Details form for digital caliper with name field, orientation, and paper size"
  }
  priority
  fill
></ExportedImage>

### 4. Adjust settings

Use the provided interface to adjust the settings for detecting the paper and object, closing corners, and hole settings. Fine-tuning these parameters will help in accurately identifying and calibrating the object.

#### Paper Detection Settings:

- **Blur size:** Adjust the blur size to reduce noise in the image.
- **Block size:** Set the block size for adaptive thresholding.

#### Object Detection Settings:

- **Blur size:** Similar to paper detection, adjust the blur size to help identify the object.
- **Block size:** Set the block size for adaptive thresholding specific to the object.
- **Threshold:** Adjust the threshold value to improve object detection.
- **Block size:** Another parameter for fine-tuning object detection.

#### Corner Closure Settings:

- **Kernel Size (px):** Define the kernel size for morphological operations.
- **Iterations:** Set the number of iterations for closing corners.

#### Hole Settings:

- **Max Background Difference:** Adjust to distinguish between the object and background.
- **Area Size Threshold:** Set the minimum area size to identify holes.

## <a name="environment-setup">Environment Setup</a>

Ensure your lighting is consistent. Avoid reflections as much as possible to get a clear image. Zoom in when taking the photo to minimize distortion. Setting up the environment perfectly will save a lot of time adjusting settings later.

## <a name="detailed-settings">Detailed Settings</a>

### <a name="bilateral-filter">Bilateral Filter</a>

Applies a bilateral filter to the image to reduce noise while keeping edges sharp. Disabled by default due to performance on mobile.

- **Disabled** - Checkbox to enable or disable the filter.
- **Pixel Diameter** - Diameter of each pixel neighborhood used during filtering.
- **Sigma Color** - Filter sigma in the color space. A larger value means that farther colors within the pixel neighborhood will be mixed together.
- **Sigma Space** - Filter sigma in the coordinate space. A larger value means that farther pixels will influence each other as long as their colors are close enough.

For more details, see the [OpenCV Bilateral Filter documentation](https://docs.opencv.org/4.10.0/d4/d86/group__imgproc__filter.html#ga9d7064d478c95d60003cf839430737ed).

### <a name="gray-scale">Gray Scale</a>

Converts the input image to grayscale, reducing it to a single color channel.

### <a name="blur-setting">Blur</a>

Blurs the image to reduce noise and details.

- **Blur Size** - The size of the kernel used for blurring the image. Larger values result in a more blurred image.

For more details, see the [OpenCV Gaussian Blur documentation](https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d4/d86/group__imgproc__filter.html#gae8bdcd9154ed5ca3cbc1766d960f45c1).

### <a name="adaptive-threshold">Adaptive Threshold</a>

Applies adaptive thresholding to binarize the image based on local neighborhood.

- **Max Value** - Maximum value to use.
- **Block Size** - Size of a pixel neighborhood that is used to calculate a threshold value for the pixel.
- **Constant** - Constant subtracted from the mean or weighted mean.

For more details, see the [OpenCV Adaptive Threshold documentation](https://docs.opencv.org/4.10.0/d7/d1b/group__imgproc__misc.html#ga72b913f352e4a1b1b397736707afcde3).

### <a name="canny-paper">Canny Paper</a>

Uses the Canny edge detector to find edges in the image.

- **First Threshold** - First threshold for the hysteresis procedure.
- **Second Threshold** - Second threshold for the hysteresis procedure.

For more details, see the [OpenCV Canny Edge Detection documentation](https://docs.opencv.org/4.10.0/dd/d1a/group__imgproc__feature.html#ga04723e007ed888ddf11d9ba04e2232de).

### <a name="extract-paper">Extract Paper</a>

Finds the largest contour and transforms the image to show only the paper.

- **Reuse Step** - Defines if previous blur data should be reused.

#### Paper Settings

- **Width** - The width of the paper in milimeters.
- **Height** - The height of the paper in milimeters.
- **Orientation** - The orientation of the paper: _Portrait_ or _Landscape_.

### Gray Scale Object

Converts the object to grayscale.

See [Gray Scale](#gray-scale) section.

### Blur Object

Disabled if **Reuse Step** is set to _Blur_

See [Blur](#blur-setting) section.

### <a name="object-threshold">Object Threshold</a>

Applies thresholding to binarize the object.

- **Threshold Type** - The type of threshold to apply: _Binary_ or _Adaptive Threshold_.

See [Adaptive Threshold](#adaptive-threshold) section.

#### Binary Threshold

Applies a simple binary threshold.

- **Threshold** - Threshold value.
- **Inverse Threshold** - Inverse threshold value.
- **Max Value** - Maximum value to use in result.

For more details, see the [OpenCV Threshold documentation](https://docs.opencv.org/4.10.0/d7/d1b/group__imgproc__misc.html#gae8a4a146d1ca78c626a53577199e9c57).

### Canny Object

Uses the Canny edge detector to find edges of the object. See [Canny Paper](#canny-paper) section.

### <a name="close-corners">Close Corners</a>

Uses morphological operations to close gaps in corners.

- **Kernel Size** - Size of the kernel used for morphological operations.
- **Iterations** - Number of times the operation is applied.

For more details, see the [OpenCV Morphological Transformations documentation](https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d9/d61/tutorial_py_morphological_ops.html).

### <a name="extract-object">Extract Object</a>

Finds the largest contour and identifies possible holes in the object.

#### <a name="smooth-settings">Smooth Settings</a>

- **Smooth Outline** - Flag to enable or disable smoothing of the object outline.
- **Smooth Max Deviation** - Maximum deviation from the original line.

#### Hole Settings

- **Max Background Difference** - Max difference between the background mean value and contour mean value in blur image.
